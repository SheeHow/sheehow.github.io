I am a Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), advised by [Dr. Dongmei Chen](https://www.me.utexas.edu/people/faculty-directory/chen) in the [Advanced Power Systems and Controls Lab](https://sites.utexas.edu/dongmeichen/). My research focuses on **control theory**, **optimization**, **reinforcement learning**, and **robotics**.

I am currently exploring applications in **robot learning** and **embodied AI**, with hands-on experience deploying vision-language-action models. My work spans deep reinforcement learning for sequential decision-making, LLM-based multi-agent frameworks for automated control synthesis, and distributionally robust predictive control.

Prior to UT Austin, I received my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from [Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/) in 2023.

## Research Interests

- **Robot Learning & Embodied AI:** Vision-language-action models, visuomotor policy learning
- **Deep Reinforcement Learning:** Curriculum learning, policy optimization for sequential decision-making
- **LLM-Based Control Synthesis:** Multi-agent LLM systems for certified controller design

## Selected Research Highlights

**LLM Multi-Agent Systems for Control Synthesis**  
Developed S2C, a multi-agent LLM framework that synthesizes certified H∞ controllers via convex optimization with provable safety guarantees. Achieved **100% synthesis success** on 14 COMPleib benchmarks.

**Deep Reinforcement Learning for Sequential Decision-Making**  
Designed curriculum-based Soft Actor-Critic with entropy-regularized policy optimization, achieving **80.2% lower tracking error** than LQR baseline with robust disturbance rejection.

**Vision-Language-Action Models**  
Deployed OpenVLA for robot manipulation tasks, gaining hands-on experience with action tokenization, visuomotor policy inference, and exploring fine-tuning strategies for task-specific adaptation.
